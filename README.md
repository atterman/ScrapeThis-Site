An open source _[FileThis|Fetch](https://filethis.com/fetch/)_ knock off.     

_FileThis|Fetch_ is awesome, but there are two things I don't love about it:

1. I'm not thrilled with giving them the passwords to my bank, retirement account, etc.
1. They're not quick about adding new sites.  At least not sites that I care about.

ScrapeThis|Site will provide the same capability in a self-hosted package.
